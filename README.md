# Spam_Filtering
In this mini-project, we will use basic NLP(Natural Language Processing) techniques and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to build a model, which will identify if a text is spam.

Multinomial Naive Bayes is one of the most popular supervised learning classification algorithm that is used for categorical text data.

The dataset we will be using contains collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages, tagged being ham(legitimate) or spam accordingly
